            In this memory game, colored squares are displayed on a grid for a
            limited time during which the player try to memorize the locations
            of the squares. When the chronometer stops, the colored squares
            automatically disappear and the player have to find the right
            locations by clicking on the empty squares. When the player feels he
            had correctly repositioned all the squares, he can then click on the
            "CHECK" button to see his result.
